# ICU_Clustering
## exploring different clustering algos for sparse ICU data sets


First project: involving MOFA2 and KMEANS to detect similar patient subpopulations
- no interpolation necessary
- fast
- features with high missingness are downweighted
- latent factors are easily explorable
- metadata can be included
- possible covariates can be included (MEFISTO) -> time series data 

Documentation:
https://biofam.github.io/MOFA2/index.html
and comments in script

Sample data will be provided on request.
